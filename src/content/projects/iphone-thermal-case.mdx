## The Problem

iPhone 12 consistently overheated during long drives with GPS navigation and charging simultaneously, causing screen dimming and app throttling. Standard cases trap heat, making the problem worse.

## Technical Approach

Designed a custom case with:
- Integrated aluminum heatsink channels
- Direct thermal contact points at processor locations
- Ventilation slots for convective cooling
- 3D-printed TPU frame for shock absorption
- Maintains MagSafe compatibility

## Results

- **Temperature reduction**: 15-20Â°C under heavy load
- **Zero throttling events** during 4-hour navigation sessions
- **Maintained wireless charging** efficiency
- Successfully field-tested on cross-country road trip
