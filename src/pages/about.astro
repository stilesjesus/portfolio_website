	<AboutSection
		title="About Me"
		mainContent={{
			intro: "Hi! I'm Jesús G. Stiles Amezcua. I'm a rising computer engineering student who likes to learn by shipping: ESP32 IoT devices, small web/back-end services on AWS, and CAD designs that become 3D-printed parts. My goal is to make clear, reliable builds—then document them so others can follow along or improve them.",
			community: "I'm deeply involved in the maker community. This year I attended Open Sauce and had the chance to meet ElectroBOOM, Jake from LTT, and William Osman. Experiences like that remind me why I build: sharing ideas, trying new tools, and helping newcomers feel welcome. I've also been active in service and leadership through Scouting (Eagle Scout) and I've attended the NSBE national convention to connect with engineers and mentors.",
			personal: "A bit about me: I grew up around beekeeping (lots of engineering problems to solve there!), and I love the outdoors—camping, hiking, and fishing whenever I can. I spent part of my childhood in Mexico, have traveled around the U.S., and I'm curious about new cultures; a recent highlight was a trip to Tokyo. At home, life is lively with three dogs, six cats, fourteen chickens, and, of course, bees. What's next? I want to stay active in the engineering community, showcase a project at Open Sauce, and post more build videos on YouTube. I'm young, learning fast, and always excited to collaborate on useful tools, fun builds, or community projects. Let's connect."
