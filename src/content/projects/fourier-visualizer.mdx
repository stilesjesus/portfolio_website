## The Problem

Students struggle to understand Fourier transforms because textbooks only show static diagrams. The relationship between time and frequency domains remains abstract without interactive visualization.

## Technical Approach

Built comprehensive educational tool:
- **Dual Visualization**: 2D traditional view and immersive 3D mode
- **Real-time Synthesis**: Web Audio API generates actual sine waves
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust frequency, amplitude, and animation speed
- **Performance Optimized**: Object pooling, buffer reuse, 60 FPS cap
- **Educational Landing**: Explains concepts with real-world applications

### Key Technical Features
- Three.js for high-performance 3D rendering
- Pre-allocated Float32Arrays for wave calculations
- Material pooling to reduce memory allocation
- Frame rate limiting to prevent CPU overload

## Results

- **Many unique users** in first 3 months
- **Adopted by local university** for DSP curriculum
- **Average session**: 8 minutes (high engagement)
- **Complex graphics**
