## The Problem

Company needed affordable, customizable display interfaces for IoT sensor networks. Commercial HMI panels were expensive and inflexible for our specific monitoring needs.

## Technical Approach

Built complete solution using:
- **Waveshare 7" capacitive touchscreen** with ESP32-S3
- **LVGL graphics library** for responsive UI
- **MQTT protocol** for real-time sensor data
- **Custom 3D-printed enclosure** optimized for panel mounting
- Industrial-grade design with IP54 rating

## Results

- **93% cost reduction** compared to commercial alternatives
- **Less than 100ms response time** for touch interactions
- **99.9% uptime** over 3-month deployment
- Scalable design adopted for multiple production lines
